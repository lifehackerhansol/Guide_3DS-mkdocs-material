1. Update your console by going to System Settings, then "Other Settings", then going all the way to the right and using "System Update"
    + The updater may display a message saying "Your system is up to date" instead of updating. This is normal if you are already up to date; continue to the next section
    + If this gives you an error, set both your DNS settings and Proxy settings to "Auto"
