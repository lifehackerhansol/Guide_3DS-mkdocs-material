!!! danger "The latest 3DS firmware is 11.17.0."

    Here's what you should know:

    + If your console is running *Luma 10.2.1 or higher*, it is *100% safe* to update. You can check your Luma version by holding (Select) while booting your console.
    + If your console is on an older Luma version, you should [update Luma](checking-for-cfw) before you update your console to 11.17.0.
    + If your console does not yet have custom firmware, **do NOT update to the latest version** unless this guide instructs you to. The methods on earlier firmwares are easier and more stable.
    + If your unmodified console is ALREADY on 11.17.0, this guide has been updated accordingly. Both [New3DS](installing-boot9strap-(super-skaterhax)) and [Old3DS](installing-boot9strap-(mset9)) now have free software methods that (for the most part) do not require external hardware or software.
