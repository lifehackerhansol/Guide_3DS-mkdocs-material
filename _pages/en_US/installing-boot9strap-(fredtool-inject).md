??? info "Technical Details (optional)"

    This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to decrypt any DSiWare title for the purposes of injecting an exploitable DSiWare title into the DS Internet Settings application.

    This is a currently working implementation of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws).

!!! warning

    You should only be able to get to this page if you are running version 11.17.0. If you are on any firmware other than 11.17.0 or 11.16.0, STOP as these instructions WILL LEAD TO A BRICK on other firmwares!!

### What You Need

* Your `movable.sed` file from completing [Seedminer](seedminer-(alternate))
* Your DSiWare backup from completing [Dumping eShop DSiWare](dumping-eshop-dsiware)
* The latest release of [Frogminer_save](https://github.com/zoogie/Frogminer/releases/latest) (`Frogminer_save.zip`)
* **11.16.0 or 11.17.0 users**: The v6.1.1 release of [b9sTool](https://github.com/zoogie/b9sTool/releases/download/v6.1.1/release_6.1.1.zip)
    * Make **absolutely sure** that you are one of these firmwares, as being on other firmwares may lead to a BRICK
* The latest release of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest) (the Luma3DS `.zip` file)
