title: "Alternate Exploits"
---

MSET9 is currently the only exploit for 3DS / 3DS XL / 2DS consoles on firmware 11.17.0 that is free and does not require any software. If you're unable to use it, you'll need to use one of these methods, which all have some sort of prerequisite.

### Installed eShop titles

Because Nintendo eShop no longer allows purchases, it is no longer possible to purchase new titles. However, you can re-download a title if you had purchased or downloaded them before purchases stopped being possible.

Any one of the following titles can be used in conjunction with Seedminer to install custom firmware:

* Mario Kart 7 (common preinstalled title; a physical cartridge also works)
* Pok√©mon Picross (free-to-play; digital only)
* Steel Diver: Sub Wars (free-to-play; digital only)
* ANY [DSiWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DSiWare_games_and_applications) title (free or paid; digital only)

Alternatively, SmileBASIC (a paid game; digital only) can be used to get Homebrew Launcher access without using Seedminer.

If you own a version 2.2 US copy of the DSiWare game Petit Computer (paid; digital only) you can use it to install boot9strap.

#### ntrboot

This method requires a compatible DS flashcart to be flashed with ntrboot, which works on all 3DS-family consoles regardless of model or region.

If none of the above options are available to you, this is the cheapest available option. If you don't already have a compatible cartridge, a preflashed ntrboot-compatible cartridge can be purchased [here](https://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=575) for roughly $20 USD.
