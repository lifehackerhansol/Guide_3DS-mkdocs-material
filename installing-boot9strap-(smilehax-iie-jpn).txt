### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work
1. Make sure SmileBASIC is updated to the latest version
1. Power off your console
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Copy `boot.firm` and `boot.3dsx` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
    + The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. Create a folder named `boot9strap` on the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` from the boot9strap `.zip` to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` from the SafeB9SInstaller `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy `new3ds_JPN.bin` or `old3ds_JPN.bin` (depending on your model) from `otherapps_with_CfgS_11.17.zip` to the root of your SD card, then rename the payload to `otherapp.bin`
    + Do not add the `.bin` extension if you do not already see it
1. Transfer `SH2E-JPN.300.wav` from the Release_sh2e `.zip` to a device that can play `.wav` files, for example a phone
1. Copy the petitcom `.icn` for your region to the root of your SD card
1. Create a folder named `3ds` on the root of your SD card if it does not already exist
    + This folder stores homebrew applications and data; it is different from the `Nintendo 3DS` folder that the console automatically generates
1. Copy the `nimdsphax` folder from the nimdsphax `.zip` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card
1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `title` -> `0004000e`
1. Rename the `00117200` folder to `_00117200`
1. Reinsert your SD card into your console
1. Power on your console
